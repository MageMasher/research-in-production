# Elm

[Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) is a functional language that compiles to
JavaScript. It competes with projects like React as a tool for
creating websites and web apps. Elm has a very strong emphasis on
simplicity, ease-of-use, and quality tooling.

### [Elm: Concurrent FRP for Functional GUIs](http://elm-lang.org/assets/papers/concurrent-frp.pdf)

_Evan Czaplicki_

__Abstract.__ Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) mediate almost all of
our interactions with computers, whether it is through web pages,
phone apps, or desktop applications. Functional Reactive Programming
(FRP) is a promising approach to GUI design. This thesis presents Elm,
a concurrent FRP language focused on easily creating responsive
GUIs. Elm has two major features: (1) purely functional graphical
layout and (2) support for Concurrent FRP. Purely functional graphical
layout is a high level framework for working with complex visual
components.  It makes it quick and easy to create and combine text,
images, and video into rich multimedia displays. Concurrent FRP solves
some of FRP’s long-standing efficiency problems: global delays and
needless recomputation. Together, Elm’s two major features simplify
the complicated task of creating responsive and usable graphical user
interfaces.  This thesis also includes a fully functional compiler for
Elm, available at elm-lang.org. This site includes an interactive code
editor that allows you to write and compile Elm programs online with
no download or install.
