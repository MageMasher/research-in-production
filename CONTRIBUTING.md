# Contributing Guidelines

Contributions are encouraged, either by adding papers to existing
lists or by adding new lists for commonly-used software system that
aren't already covered.

I ask that contributors abide by the following guidelines when
submitting pull requests.

* __Categorize publications by "top-level" projects__. The point of
  Research In Production is to showcase the literature behind concrete
  software projects rather than by abstract subject matter. For
  instance, a paper on a garbage collection algorithm used in a
  programming language's VM would be added to the language's list
  rather than a more generic list on GC algorithms.

* __Categorize publications according to whether they preceded or were
  a result of a system's development__. A system list is broken down
  into two sections for a) preceding research that influenced the
  system's design and b) publications that fell out of the development
  process of the system itself.

* __Follow the existing markup style__. Individual publication records
  within a system list should look like this:

  ```
  ## [Paper Title](URL of paper PDF, if publicly available)

  _Author, Author, and Author_

  __Abstract.__ This is the paper's abstract. Lorem ipsum dolor sit
  amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Curabitur lobortis mollis urna, sit
  amet lobortis eros interdum vel. Proin convallis iaculis leo. Aliquam
  facilisis, velit sit amet viverra imperdiet, nisl sapien suscipit
  eros, ut porta tortor sem et nunc. Fusce pharetra eros id mauris
  dictum tempor. Nulla eleifend eros at aliquam iaculis. Integer gravida
  urna velit, in ultrices lorem efficitur ac. Vestibulum ante ipsum
