# Research In Production

A collection of computer science and engineering research papers
categorized by real-world systems that enact them.

## FAQ

### What is this?

Engineering as a discipline is driven by a healthy balance between
research and development. This project is an attempt to bolster
appreciation for the former by shedding light on some of the academic
and industrial research behind commonly-used softare systems.

Most non-trivial software systems* are powered by concepts and
techniques that came into being after a group of people put a lot of
effort into thinking their way through a tough problem. These concepts
are typically hidden beneath the surface of abstractions and are thus
not easily appreciable. When writing a program, you probably don't
have time or motivation to dig into exactly how a data structure
handles concurrency or what happens to all the objects you're wantonly
creating.

This project is for those that want to go deeper, whether for the
simple satisfaction of knowing how a thing works or to
[level up](https://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/2011/07/why-mechanical-sympathy.html)
their ability to build systems.

The common wisdom directed at newcomers looking to get involved in
open source software is to pick a project that they use and contribute
to it by knocking out documentation and tests. Along similar lines, I
think a good way to dip one's toes into research literature is to dig
into papers related to systems that they already use. This could
involve some aspect of a programming language, a library, or a
database that you've used to build something in the past.

Every software developer benefits from academic and industrial
research. Research In Production is for those that want to know how.

\* "System" is a generic term. Programming languages are highlighted
in the first rendition of this project, but this approach could just
as easily be applied to any technological artifact.

### But Papers We Love is already a thing!

[Papers We Love](http://paperswelove.org/) is fantastic. Research In
Production shares its motivations in fostering community around
publications, but with a narrower focus on publications that directly
relate to commonly-used software systems.

Ideally this project would _complement_ PWL by organizing a subset of
its literature by the systems that put it into practice.

### Where do the lists come from?

If you know of a software project that leverages research topics in
production systems, then it warrants a spot in this project.

Research In Production was seeded with content from existing lists put
together by [Alex Denisov](https://github.com/AlexDenisov) and
[Matt Warren](https://github.com/mattwarren/). I added
[a list for a project that I used to work on](https://github.com/evnm/research-in-production/blob/master/finagle.md)
and I encourage you to do the same.
