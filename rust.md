# Rust

The Rust team team maintains
[a reading list](https://forge.rust-lang.org/bibliography.html) of
publications that are relevant to the Rust language. It "includes
prior research that has—at one time or another—influenced the design
of Rust, as well as publications about Rust."

Rather than reinventing the wheel, we'll defer to this list.
